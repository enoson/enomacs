# enomacs
There're already a lot of .emacs.d out there that are "powerful", which confirms "Emacs is a great OS lacking only a decent editor". This .emacs.d, on the other hand, provides a lean config that's relevant only to text editing.

It's suitable for Mac users who think faster than type, if you type faster than think, use Vim or Spacemacs instead, if you want to appear type very fast, follow this [guide](https://github.com/redguardtoo/mastering-emacs-in-one-year-guide) instead.
